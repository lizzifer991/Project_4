        <br>
        <p1>Type 1 is not preventable since it is genetically based on family history and is considered an autoimmune condition in which the body does not produce insulin. Age does not play a role in whether you develop type 1 diabetes since you can develop it at any age. It is more common in children, teenagers, and young adults. </p1>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p2>Type 2 can be prevented or at least can be delayed with proven lifestyle changes. The risk factors for type 2 diabetes are: prediabetes, overweightness, 45 years or older, having a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes, being physically active less than 3 times a week, having had gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy), or having given birth to a baby that weighed over 9 pounds. If you have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, you may also be a risk for type 2. </p2>
        <p3>Prediabetes is where you are at risk of developing diabetes. The risk factors are the same risk factors as type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes can be prevented or reversed with proven lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular physical activity. </p3>
